      <p>
        A senior product manager with 11 years of experience in enterprise
        product development for the travel & hospitality as well e-commerce
        industries. An adaptable, personable, and creative professional with the
        ability to align technological progress and long-term value creation.
      </p>
      <h2 class="my-4">PERSONAL STATEMENT</h2>
      <p>
        If you would ask me what my biggest accomplishement was, I would maybe
        surprise you. My boss once asked me to come up with a new corporate tool
        to support the entire global sales teams. A hyper modern sales tool that
        gave the sales teams, all the necessary information to perform at better
        their task. I got 3 months to come up with a prototype and roadmap
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of looking how other competitors used complex systems to provide
        realtime information through smart algorithms. And doing months of
        discovery. I asked a select group of sales reps, what would be the
        biggest support to have when conducting sales. Their answers were
        simple. I have to find the right info as quick as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        My minimal viable product was a simple powerpoint build in way to find
        the most important information in 3 clicks with hyperlinks to our online
        saleschannel for images and video's. Its crazy how much you can do with
        simple powerpoint tools. My boss a bit surprised of the outcome,
        thinking I would come with a realtime web application, did not really
        like it. However still today this first version is being used in the
        organization although slightly optimized. And today we have a web
        application with the necessary information.
